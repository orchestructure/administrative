## Orchestructure Code of Conduct

The following applies to all Orchestructure related resources, events, and other public opportunities in which Orchestructure operates in any capacity. This includes but is not limited to our [Github presence](https://github.com/orchestructure), [meetup hosting](https://www.meetup.com/orchestructure/), [Slack channel](https://madeina2.slack.com/messages/C45JHC0A0/), and any other projects, events, efforts, etc., in-person or digital.

### Events Code of Conduct

Orchestructure and its project communities are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at all of our events. Orchestructure events are working meetups intended for professional networking and collaboration within the open source, DevOps, and local communities. They exist to encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. While at Orchestructure events or related ancillary or social events, any participants, including members, speakers, attendees, volunteers, sponsors, exhibitors, booth staff and anyone else, should not engage in harassment in any form.

This Code of Conduct may be revised at any time by the Orchestructure board and the terms are non-negotiable. Your attendance at any Orchestructure event indicates your agreement to abide by this policy and its terms.

#### Expected Behavior

All event participants are expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, with both this Code of Conduct as well as their respective employer’s policies governing appropriate workplace behavior and applicable laws.

#### Unacceptable Behavior

Harassment will not be tolerated in any form, including, but not limited to, harassment based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other status protected by laws in which the conference or program is being held. Harassment includes the use of abusive, offensive or degrading language, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, sexual imagery and unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors. Any report of harassment at one of our events will be addressed immediately. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Anyone who witnesses or is subjected to unacceptable behavior should notify a meetup/event organizer at once.

Exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material in their booths/areas and must refrain from the use of sexualized clothing, uniforms, costumes, or otherwise creating a sexualized environment. Speakers should not use sexual language, images, or any language or images that would constitute harassment as defined above in their talks.

Individuals who participate (or plan to participate) in Orchestructure events should conduct themselves at all times in a manner that comports with both the letter and spirit of this policy prohibiting harassment and abusive behavior, whether before, during or after the event. This includes statements made in social media postings, online publications, text messages, and all other forms of electronic communication.

#### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate depending on the circumstances, ranging from issuance of a warning to the offending individual to expulsion from the event, and if charged with no refund. Orchestructure organizers reserve the right to exclude any participant found to be engaging in harassing behavior from participating in any further Orchestructure events, trainings or other activities.

If a participant (or individual wishing to participate in a Orchestructure event), through postings on social media or other online publications or another form of electronic communication, engages in conduct that violates this policy, whether before, during or after a Orchestructure event, the Orchestructure organizers may take appropriate corrective action, which could include imposing a temporary or permanent ban on an individual’s participation in future Orchestructure events.

#### What to do if you Witness or are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns relating to harassment, please contact a member of [Orchestructure Organizers](https://www.meetup.com/orchestructure/members/?op=leaders). The Organizers will introduce themselves at the beginning of every event, with at least one on-site at all times for its duration. The Orchestructure Organizers may also be contacted via email at orchestructure.meetup (at) gmail (dot) com.

#### Incident Response

Our staff/organizers will respond to all harassment reports with utmost urgency. As referenced above, if a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, ranging from issuance of a warning to the offending individual to expulsion from the event, if charged with no refund. Orchestructure reserves the right to exclude any participant found to be engaging in harassing behavior from participating in any further Orchestructure events, trainings or other activities.

Event staff will also provide support to victims, including, but not limited to: Providing an Escort, Contacting Venue security or local law encforcement, and briefing key event staff for response/victim assistance. In addition, staff will assist those experiencing harassment to ensure they feel safe for the duration of the event.

#### Pre-Event Concerns

If you are planning to attend an upcoming event and have concerns regarding another individual who may be present, please contact the Orchestructure organizers at orchestructure.meetup (at) gmail (dot) com. Precautions will be taken to ensure your comfort and safety, including, but not limited to: providing an escort, prepping onsite event staff, keeping victim and harasser from attending the same talks/social events and providing onsite contact cell phone numbers for immediate contact.
